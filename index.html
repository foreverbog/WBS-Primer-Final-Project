                        <h2> #1. India becomes world’s most populous country</h2>
                        <p>2023 witnessed India surpassing its neighbour China to become the world's most populous country, boasting an estimated population of 1.43 billion people. Projections suggest that India is likely to maintain this status for decades to come.</p>
                        <p>“In April 2023, India’s population is expected to reach 1,425,775,850 people, matching and then surpassing the population of mainland China,” the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs observed in a report.</p>
                        <p>“In 1971, China and India had nearly identical levels of total fertility, with just under 6 births per woman over a lifetime. Fertility in China fell sharply to fewer than 3 births per woman by the end of the 1970s (figure 3). By contrast, the fertility decline in India has been more gradual: it took three and a half decades for India to experience the same fertility reduction that occurred in China over just seven years in the 1970s,” it added.</p>
                        <p>According to the Pew Research Centre, India's population has grown by more than one billion people since 1950- the year the UN started gathering population data. This comes as China's population, in 2022, shrank for the first time since 1960. Amid declining population and below replacement rate fertility, Beijing ended its strict "one-child policy", imposed in the 1980s in 2016 and started letting couples have three children in 2021.</p>

The summit saw the participation of 43 heads of various governments, including US President Biden, Canada PM Justin Trudeau, and British PM Rishi Sunak. Under the theme “One Earth, One Family, One Future,” the G20 leaders discussed several important topics of global concern.</p>
                        <p>“During the presidency, India is focused on various issues like inclusive growth, digital innovation, climate resilience, and equitable global health access. By leveraging its presidency, India is fostering collaborative solutions that not only benefit its own population but contribute to the broader global well-being, reinforcing its spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam or the World is One Family,” the centre said.</p>
                        <p>“We are determined to steer the world out of its current challenges and build a safer, stronger, more resilient, inclusive and healthier future for our people and the planet,” G20 New Delhi leaders’ declaration.</p>
